## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Workflow

1. **Async Crawler**: Uses `aiohttp` and `pyquery` for fast, non-blocking scraping
2. **Job Filtering**: Extracts and filters jobs by title keywords and location
3. **Batching**: Groups jobs for Discord delivery (configurable batch size)
4. **Discord Integration**: Sends jobs via Webhook or Bot (with per-message auto-delete)
5. **Auto-Stop**: Stops automatically after crawling all pages or if no jobs are found

## üìñ Usage

### Webhook Mode (Default)

1. Set your Discord Webhook URL in `cake_qa_crawler.py`:
   ```python
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxxx/yyyy"
   ```
2. Run the crawler:
   ```bash
   python cake_qa_crawler.py
   ```
3. Jobs will be sent to your Discord channel in batches. The script stops after all pages are crawled.

### Bot Mode (Per-message auto-delete)

1. [Create a Discord Bot and invite it to your server.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Get your Bot Token and Channel ID (see FAQ below).
3. Use the following sample code to send and auto-delete messages:

   ```python
   import discord
   import asyncio

   TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'
   CHANNEL_ID = 123456789012345678

   intents = discord.Intents.default()
   client = discord.Client(intents=intents)

   @client.event
   async def on_ready():
       channel = client.get_channel(CHANNEL_ID)
       msg = await channel.send("This is a job message!")
       asyncio.create_task(delete_later(msg, 604800))  # 7 days (or any seconds you want)
       await client.close()

   async def delete_later(msg, delay):
       await asyncio.sleep(delay)
       await msg.delete()

   client.run(TOKEN)
   ```

   **Now, each message sent by the bot will be automatically deleted after the specified time (e.g., 7 days or 20 seconds).**

#### Advantages of Per-message Auto-delete

- Every job message is deleted automatically after its own countdown (e.g., 7 days after it is sent)
- No need for batch deletion or scheduled tasks
- Keeps the channel clean and always up-to-date

#### Note

- Bot can only delete messages it sent itself (not webhook or other users' messages)
- Make sure the bot has "Manage Messages" permission in the channel
